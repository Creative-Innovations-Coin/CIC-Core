Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: peer-to-peer digital currency - standalone transaction tool

 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Cic Core
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.

 This package provides cic-tx, a command-line transaction creation
 tool which can be used without a cic daemon.  Some means of
 exchanging minimal transaction data with peers is still required.
